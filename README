shroudBNC 1.3
-------------

shroudBNC is a modular IRC proxy written in C++. It is capable of proxying
IRC connections for multiple users. Using TCL scripts it can be extended.

Installation
------------

Please read the INSTALL file for more details about how to install shroudBNC.

Usage
-----

Just connect to the bouncer using your favorite IRC client. You will have to set
your username (i.e. e-mail address in most clients) to the accountname you've
chosen for your bouncer account. If for some reason you can't change your
client's username you can specify the username in the password setting (of the form
username:password).

Once you're connected you should type /msg -sBNC help to get a list of available commands.

shroudBNC supports oidentd in order to provide unique idents for each bouncer
user. You will need to enable ident-spoofing for the unix account you're using
to run shroudBNC if you want each user to have their own ident. Read oidentd's
manual or http://wiki.shroudbnc.info/en/oidentd for more details.

TCL
---

The tcl module is automatically built and installed if the configure script
was able to find the appropriate tcl libraries and headers.

If the configure script was unable to find the TCL libraries/headers and you
are sure that they are installed you might use the --with-tcl parameter to
specify the location of the tclConfig.sh file manually; e.g.:

./configure --with-tcl=/usr/local/ActiveTcl/tcl8.4

Log files
---------

shroudBNC automatically re-creates log files if they disappear during runtime. It
also re-opens them if their inode of dev numbers change. Therefore rotating logs
is as easy as moving the existing logs to a different location.

Security
--------

It is vital that you understand that any bouncer admin has access to:

a) the shell account where the bouncer is running
b) any user connections

Using the TCL module any admin can perform shell commands (using the exec
command) and send IRC commands for any user's connection. Thus you should
choose your admins wisely. Do not load arbitrary scripts and make sure you
understand any scripts you want to load.
